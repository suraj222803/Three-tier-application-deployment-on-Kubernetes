# Three-Tier Application Deployment on Kubernetes (EKS)

**what do you mean by three tier ?**
It’s actually a division of your system in 3 parts

1. **Presentation Layer (Tier 1):**
   
What you you see when you open your website is called the presentation layer basically it is the layer that users interact directly
2. **Logical Layer (Tier 2):**

Imagine this layer as the brain behind the scenes. It takes the information you provide through the user interface and processes it according to the rules of the system. If it’s a shopping website, for instance, this layer figures out things like the total price of your items, applies discounts, and checks if everything is in stock
3. **Data Layer (Tier 3):**

- This is where the data is stored and retrieved. It’s like the memory of the system.
- Data could be stored in databases, files, or any other data storage systems.
- The data layer is responsible for managing and storing information that the system needs.

## Phase 1 →Setup base EC2 , IAM user and Basic tools on EC2
**Step 1. Create an IAM user**

11. click next and download you csv file for username and password

**Step 2. launching a base EC2 where we do all work**

1. open your aws console and navigate to ec2 and click on launch ec2

2. Click on connect and run the following commands
```text
sudo su
apt update
mkdir 3-tier
cd 3-tier
```

3. fetch the code from github by git clone
   ```text
   https://github.com/suraj222803/Three-tier-application-deployment-on-Kubernetes.git

   ```
4. Run ls to see the what is inside the repo

**Step 3 --> Setup aws cli ,docker ,kubectl and eksctl **
